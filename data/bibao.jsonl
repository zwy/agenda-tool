Sesamol has been reported to alleviate colitis symptoms and depression-like behaviors caused by chronic unpredictable mild stress, but its protective effect and underlying neurobiological mechanism on IBD induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) accompanying depression-like and anxiety-like behaviors remains still unclear.", "methods": "DSS-induced IBD model; Behavior testing; Sesamol gavage", "results": "We found that a six-week sesamol treatment (100 mg/kg bodyweight/day) for DSS-induced mice predominantly prevented inflammation response, epithelial barrier dysfunction and depression-like and anxiety-like behaviors via a gut-brain axis. Sesamol alleviated neuroinflammatory responses via suppressing TLR-4/NF-κB pathway, protected against oxidative stress and upregulated Nrf2 antioxidative signaling pathway. Moreover, sesamol treatment improved brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) by upregulating the BDNF/TrkB/CREB signaling pathway, restored synaptic impairments and enhanced norepinephrine (NE) and serotonin (5-HT) levels. Importantly, the correlation analysis showed that the gut barrier and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) content in serum were highly associated with behavioral perfomance and biochemical indexes of brain.", "conclusion": "In summary, the present study indicates that sesamol is a novel nutritional intervention strategy for preventing IBD and its symptoms of anxiety and depression.", "images": "https://cdn.mr-gut.cn/chinagut/240925/32f3583db3157811fe06f64a0671505a.jpg", "keywords": "IBD; Depression; Sesamol", "aliyunVid": "", "duration": "", "permission": "", "cover": ""}

Meanwhile, there was a striking difference between mucosal microbiota and fecal microbiota, indicating the risk of using fecal microbiota to define intestinal microecology. Fusobacterium nucleatum was significantly abundant in carcinoma mucosa compared to normal and adenoma mucosa. Compared to normal mucosa, SCFAs producing bacteria was significantly depleted, while Actinomyces odontolyticus was higher in adenoma, and LC-MS/MS results suggest that tryptophan metabolites, taurine and unsaturated fatty acids were significantly elevated in adenoma. Oral opportunistic bacteria such as Fusobacterium and Streptococcus appear to be consistently over-represented in carcinoma, while Bacillus subtilis was significantly decreased compared to adenoma. Metabolome analyses showed that L-kynurenine and Myristic acid were significantly increased in carcinoma. Further integrated analysis showed that gut microbiota dysbiosis is associated with metabolomic alterations.", "conclusion": "Compositional alterations in the microbiota and metabolite profile existed in CRC patients with synchronous adenoma.
