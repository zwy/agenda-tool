  "background": "Studies have reported that gut microbiota and its metabolites are closely related to colorectal cancer (CRC). CRC with synchronous adenomas is characterized by simultaneous precancerous polyps in same intestinal segments haboring malignant lesions, making this condition an ideal model for studying the multistep CRC progression. However, microbial and metabolomic alterations in normal, adenoma and carcinoma mucosa from same CRC individuals remain to be strengthened.",

  "results": "We found significant microbial and metabolite variations among normal mucosa, adenoma mucosa and carcinoma mucosa. Meanwhile, there was a striking difference between mucosal microbiota and fecal microbiota, indicating the risk of using fecal microbiota to define intestinal microecology. Fusobacterium nucleatum was significantly abundant in carcinoma mucosa compared to normal and adenoma mucosa. Compared to normal mucosa, SCFAs producing bacteria was significantly depleted, while Actinomyces odontolyticus was higher in adenoma, and LC-MS/MS results suggest that tryptophan metabolites, taurine and unsaturated fatty acids were significantly elevated in adenoma. Oral opportunistic bacteria such as Fusobacterium and Streptococcus appear to be consistently over-represented in carcinoma, while Bacillus subtilis was significantly decreased compared to adenoma. Metabolome analyses showed that L-kynurenine and Myristic acid were significantly increased in carcinoma. Further integrated analysis showed that gut microbiota dysbiosis is associated with metabolomic alterations.",
  "conclusion": "Compositional alterations in the microbiota and metabolite profile existed in CRC patients with synchronous adenoma. Mucosal microbiota reprogramming in CRC patients is associated with alterations of the mucosal metabolome. Mucosal microbiota reprogramming in CRC patients is associated with alterations of the mucosal metabolome.
