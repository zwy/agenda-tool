  "reportTitle": "Sesamol Ameliorates Dextran Sulfate Sodium-induced Depression-like and Anxiety-like Behaviors in Colitis Mice：The potential involvement of Gut-Brain Axis",
  "theme": "炎症性肠病",
  "name": "test001",
  "employer": "西北农林科技大学，中国",
  "position": "研究生",
  "background": "Inﬂammatory bowel disease (IBD) is accompanied by some psychiatric disorders, including anxiety and depression. Sesamol has been reported to alleviate colitis symptoms and depression-like behaviors caused by chronic unpredictable mild stress, but its protective effect and underlying neurobiological mechanism on IBD induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) accompanying depression-like and anxiety-like behaviors remains still unclear.",
  "methods": "DSS-induced IBD model; Behavior testing; Sesamol gavage",
  "results": "We found that a six-week sesamol treatment (100 mg/kg bodyweight/day) for DSS-induced mice predominantly prevented inflammation response, epithelial barrier dysfunction and depression-like and anxiety-like behaviors via a gut-brain axis. Sesamol alleviated neuroinflammatory responses via suppressing TLR-4/NF-κB pathway, protected against oxidative stress and upregulated Nrf2 antioxidative signaling pathway. Moreover, sesamol treatment improved brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) by upregulating the BDNF/TrkB/CREB signaling pathway, restored synaptic impairments and enhanced norepinephrine (NE) and serotonin (5-HT) levels. Importantly, the correlation analysis showed that the gut barrier and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) content in serum were highly associated with behavioral perfomance and biochemical indexes of brain.",
  "conclusion": "In summary, the present study indicates that sesamol is a novel nutritional intervention strategy for preventing IBD and its symptoms of anxiety and depression.",
